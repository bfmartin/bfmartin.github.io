<p>This page lists some unusual Dilbert strips. If you know of others, please let me know and I will add them here.</p>

<h2 id="versions">Versions</h2>

<p>These are alternative versions to what was published in newspapers, although in some cases, the alternative version was the one published. Most of these are due to Scott’s delightful sense of humour being too much for newspaper editors who want to protect their readers.</p>

<dl>

<dt><span class="striptitle">Uber Driver</span> <span class="stripdate">2016-03-01</span></dt>
<dd>A rough version of the strip was <a href="http://blog.dilbert.com/post/136757259916/writing-tips-for-humorists">published</a> on <span class="stripdate">2016-01-06</span>. The rough version had the finished dialogue and rough pencil sketches for the characters, Asok and Wally. This strip was part of the six-week "Vacation Artist" period, so was likely a strip supplied to the artist for them to draw. In this case, the artist was John Glynn.</dd>

<dt><span class="striptitle">Do No Harm</span> <span class="stripdate">2015-09-04</span></dt>
<dd>A <a href="https://twitter.com/ScottAdamsSays/status/646327203500683264">strip</a> showing the too violent version and the published version. The too violent version ended with Alice, having punched through the back of the robot's head, saying "Remember how I argued that robots should not have rear sensors? This is why." The published version had her saying "I gave you the personality of a guy."</dd>

<dt><span class="striptitle">Not Genuine</span> <span class="stripdate">2014-12-17</span></dt>
<dd>Scott had some Windows problems and had to phone tech support. From that, he created a strip (published on <a href="http://dilbert.com/strip/2015-03-01">2015-03-01</a>) and published a <a href="http://blog.dilbert.com/post/105476872276/boring-little-story-about-my-windows-computer">preview</a> of the first two panels.</dd>

<dt><span class="striptitle">Bitcoin Thief</span> <span class="stripdate">2014-04-02</span></dt>
<dd>Scott published to first two panels of an upcoming strip on <a href="http://dilbert.com/blog/entry/who_didnt_see_this_coming/">2014-02-13</a>. The first two panels are Dogbert describing how he will steal bitcoins from dumb criminals. The third panel reads "This panel will be available 4-2-14"</dd>

<dt><span class="striptitle">Desiccated Crone</span> <span class="stripdate">2013-10-30</span></dt>
<dd>Another alternative ending that was deemed too strong. The Boss hires a <a href="http://dilbert.com/blog/entry/rejected_dilbert_comic_again/">desiccated crone</a> to teach the engineers to eat with manners. The rejected version has Alice saying "this class is a big fork cue." The published version contains "When I'm too lazy to make a shiv?"</dd>

<dt><span class="striptitle">Bank Deposit</span> <span class="stripdate">2012-07-14</span></dt>
<dd>Scott makes fun of banks when <a href="http://dilbert.com/blog/entry/stickiopolies/">Dilbert makes a deposit</a>. The bank teller says honesty "makes cross-selling harder" in the published version and an early version has "makes cross-selling a bitch."</dd>

<dt><span class="striptitle">Where Marketing Data Comes From</span> <span class="stripdate">2006-11-21</span></dt>
<dd>The original showed a marketing person with an ass for a head pulling a document out of his head. The published version had the ass on the top of his head covered by underpants and the document coming out through the waistband. <span class="booktitle">Stick to Drawing Comics, Monkey Brain!</span>, page 265.</dd>

<dt><span class="striptitle">Asok's Butt</span> <span class="stripdate">2006-06-24</span></dt>
<dd>The original drawing showed Asok's naked butt. The editors thought that too many people would complain so the comic was redrawn with underpants. The underpants showed the outline of Asok's buttocks, but no-one complained. <span class="booktitle">Stick to Drawing Comics, Monkey Brain!</span>, page 130.</dd>

<dt><span class="striptitle">Porn is too Strong a Word</span> <span class="stripdate">2006-03-05</span></dt>
<dd>Scott's editor objected to the use of the word porn ("There's too much porn on your hard drive") and so suggested smut to replace it. Scott published just the one panel containing the word in question, not the whole strip, on <span class="stripdate">2006-01-23</span>.</dd>

<dt><span class="striptitle">It Keeps Uranus Warm</span> <span class="stripdate">2006-04-03</span></dt>
<dd>This one snuck by the censors but some newspapers' editors changed Uranus to Pluto. So Scott claims, tho' I haven't seen the changed one to verify.</dd>

<dt><span class="striptitle">Internet is Full</span> <span class="stripdate">2006-02-22</span></dt>
<dd>This strip was adapted, with changed dialog, into a <a href="http://dilbert.com/img/v1/404.gif">404 page</a>. The Boss asks about a 404 page instead of e-mail not working.</dd>

<dt><span class="striptitle">Jet-Lagged Baby</span> <span class="stripdate">2006-01-25</span></dt>
<dd>A baby in the office stares at a well-endowed woman presumably wanting to breast-feed. The tamer, newspaper-published version had the dialogue "Hey, I just got a crazy idea." The original version, published on the internet comic web sites, contained "Less talking, more burping." <span class="booktitle">Stick to Drawing Comics, Monkey Brain!</span>, page 75.</dd>

<dt><span class="striptitle">When Life Gives You Lemons</span> <span class="stripdate">2005-12-09</span></dt>
<dd>Scott published an version of this strip a few days early on his blog. The early version had the dialogue in the first panel intact, but the rest of the dialogue removed. Scott asked his blog readers to supply their own lines in the comments section and then quoted the ones he liked. This is a fore-runner of the Mashup section at the Dilbert site.</dd>

<dt><span class="striptitle">Interviewing the Boss's Pet</span> <span class="stripdate">2005-11-03</span></dt>
<dd>This one contains a reference to sexual harassment that's subtle enough for most people to miss ("now do the leg thing"). The published version replaced the last panel with the Boss saying something complimentary and mundane ("nice furrowing of the brows"). <span class="booktitle">Stick to Drawing Comics, Monkey Brain!</span>, page 20.</dd>

<dt><span class="striptitle">Porpoise Attacking a Shark</span> <span class="stripdate">2005-09-06</span></dt>
<dd>The tame version showed a lawyer's body with a large, porpoise-snout-sized hole in the middle of his back. The offensive version showed the lawyer's body with the porpoise still lodged up his rear end. <span class="booktitle">Stick to Drawing Comics, Monkey Brain!</span>, page 11.</dd>

<dt><span class="striptitle">Is that Donut Loaded?</span> <span class="stripdate">2005-08-04</span></dt>
<dd>Scott shows some early versions of the strip. The first version showed a police officer shooting his gun. Since there is a "rule" against guns firing in comics, the depiction of the shooting was replaced by the entire panel showing Bam, Bam in the second version. The final version reverted back to the original drawing except that the gun firing bullets was replaced by a donut firing some bullets. That, apparently, is OK. <span class="booktitle">Stick to Drawing Comics, Monkey Brain!</span>, pages 7 and 8</dd>

<dt><span class="striptitle">Breeding Owls</span> <span class="stripdate">2005-05-17</span></dt>
<dd>A version with the final panel covered with a sign that said it was "hilarious but offensive" and the reader could go to dilbert.com to see it. Some papers published the uncensored version.</dd>

<dt><span class="striptitle">Wally Surviving in Jail</span> <span class="stripdate">2001-05-09</span></dt>
<dd>The newspaper version has Wally trying to impress his cellmate by wanting to get temporary tattoos at the gift shop. The web version replaced the last panel with Wally asking his cellmate to close his eyes and whistle while Wally used the toilet.</dd>

<dt><span class="striptitle">Brand Awareness</span> <span class="stripdate">2000-08-06</span></dt>
<dd>The web version showed Wally's butt cleavage as he was being branded. The newspaper version had that censored and just left his butt smooth.</dd>

<dt><span class="striptitle">Face Time</span> <span class="stripdate">2000-02-09</span></dt>
<dd>The newspaper version shows a VP making faces at Dilbert. The web-only version replaces the last panel with Dilbert watching another employee kissing the VP on the ass. "He's still giving face time to someone else."</dd>

<dt><span class="striptitle">Special Olympics</span> <span class="stripdate">1999-01-06</span></dt>
<dd>The web version contained a phrase that was considered "in poor taste" and it was changed for the newspaper version.</dd>

<dt><span class="striptitle">Still Beating Heart</span> <span class="stripdate">1998-09-05</span></dt>
<dd>The published version has three panels and the web version had a fourth panel. The extra panel showed Alice being violent.</dd>

<dt><span class="striptitle">It Might Have Sucked</span> <span class="stripdate">1997-07-17</span></dt>
<dd>There were two versions published in newspapers that day depending on the editor's choice. One version contained the word sucked. The alternative version replaced that with been useless.</dd>

<dt><span class="striptitle">The O-Word</span> <span class="stripdate">1997-08-18</span></dt>
<dd>This strip shows Dilbert recruiting students. The strip had Dilbert misleadingly comparing meetings to parties: "I'm not allowed to say the O-word" appeared in the newspaper version. The web version had orgy instead of the O-word.</dd>

<dl>

<dt><span class="striptitle">Wearing Masks</span> <span class="stripdate">2020-04-20</span></dt>
<dd>A black-and-white <a href="https://twitter.com/ScottAdamsSays/status/1252329907914280961">rough drawing</a> of a closeup of Dilbert, the Boss, and Wally, wearing facial masks. Scott says not having to draw noses saves a ton of time.</dd>

<dt><span class="striptitle">Working at Home</span> <span class="stripdate">2020-03-25</span></dt>
<dd>Scott announces that Dilbert will soon be working at home (probably because of the Covid19 virus isolation) with a colour <a href="https://twitter.com/ScottAdamsSays/status/1242871384180527104">sketch</a> of Dilbert and Dogbert sitting on a couch with some pillows.

<dd>A sketch of a <a href="https://twitter.com/ScottAdamsSays/status/681185045109850113">proposed re-design</a> of the Dilbert character. It featured eyes, no glasses, eyebrows, a mouth and a smaller nose.</dd>

<dt><span class="striptitle">Just Testing</span> <span class="stripdate">2014-02-12</span></dt>
<dd>Scott was having troubles with his blog, so <a href="http://dilbert.com/blog/entry/testimage/">published</a> a few images for testing purposes.

<ul>
<li>A single panel of Robots Read News that was large. The caption reads "This is just a test to see if the dimensions of the image matter."</li>
<li>A blank strip used as the template for his daily strips. Three blank panels with the site name, email address and copyright information.</li>
<li>A blank strip with a partially finished drawing of the Boss in the centre panel. The drawing of the head and torso has no eyes or mouth. This strip comes in GIF and lower-resolution JPEG versions.</li>
<li>Another posting of the "This is Nuts" strip. See the entry below for more information.</li>
</ul>
</dd>

<dt><span class="striptitle">This is Nuts</span> <span class="stripdate">2012-05-18</span></dt>
<dd>This one was <a href="http://www.dilbert.com/blog/entry/the_one_that_didnt_get_published/">turned down by censors</a>, a rare event according to Scott. The Boss shows the new company logo consisting of a heart growing out of the earth and branches growing out of it. When viewed upside down, it looks like hairy testicles. Published in Scott's blog on 2012-03-27.</dd>

<dt><span class="striptitle">Lust Dust</span> <span class="stripdate">2012-04-30</span></dt>
<dd>The editor thought it was <a href="http://dilbert.com/blog/entry/lust_dust/">inappropriate for newspapers</a>. Dogbert gives the Boss some magic dust used by Apple on all their consumer products. The jar top isn't on tight and the Boss spills some on himself. Published in Scott's blog on 2012-04-30.</dd>

<dt><span class="striptitle">Pirate's Peg Leg</span> <span class="stripdate">2011-05-09</span></dt>
<dd>A <a href="http://dilbert.com/blog/entry/pirate_peg_leg/">rough draft of a strip</a> that will never be published in newspapers. This one has Alice saying that she's no longer allowed to use her fist of death at work, but she is allowed to use her foot of death. She wears Asok upside down as a peg leg.</dd>

<dt><span class="striptitle">Dogbert's Flawed Financial Products</span> <span class="stripdate">2010-04-28</span></dt>
<dd>Another <a href="http://dilbert.com/blog/entry/confusopolyhearings/">unfinished strip</a> that would have been stale by the time it was published. This one shows Dogbert being questioned by Congress about his setting up flawed financial products and then betting they would fail. They ask Dogbert how he lives with himself and Dogbert replies that the servants help. Scott calls it a Confusopoly.</dd>

<dt><span class="striptitle">Wally Loses a 4G Phone</span> <span class="stripdate">2010-04-26</span></dt>
<dd>Based on recent events in technology news, Scott calls <a href="http://dilbert.com/blog/entry/thatlost4gphone/">these two strips</a> "unfinished drafts" and they'll never been seen in newspapers. The first strip show Wally borrowing a secret 4G phone prototype and then taking it to a bar and getting drunk. Other people in the bar are a blogger and seller of other people's property. The second strip shows Wally confessing to the Boss that he lost the phone. It started mis-spelling words after his fourth beer. He suggests calling the incident a clever marketing ploy.</dd>

<dt><span class="striptitle">How to Read a Book Quickly</span> <span class="stripdate">2008</span></dt>
<dd>This is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Dilbert-2-0-20-Years/dp/0740777351/">published</a> on the Amazon website in conjunction with the publishing of the <span class="booktitle">Dilbert 2.0</span> book.</dd>

<dt><span class="striptitle">Crack Team</span> <span class="stripdate">2001-04-03</span></dt>
<dd>In this strip, the Boss asks Dilbert to put together a crack team and the joke is that a team member shows some butt cleavage.</dd>

<dt><span class="striptitle">Corn Starch</span> <span class="stripdate">1995-05-04</span></dt>
<dd>A newspaper web site was reprinting older strips and got tangled up in the dates. So United Media made an unpublished strip available to fill in a gap. It shows Dogbert sitting on a pillow, contemplating corn starch, and wondering why people would iron corn. (The date in the URL was <span class="stripdate">1995-05-04</span> and the date written in the strip is <span class="stripdate">2000-06-03</span>)</dd>

<dt><span class="striptitle">Mark, I'd like you to…</span> <span class="stripdate">1994-08-01</span></dt>
<dd>This was sent out in case newspaper editors objected to the phrase Uranus-Hertz. The strip containing Uranus-Hertz was published in the book Fugitive from the Cubicle Police. The alternative strip, which was completely different, was published in a desktop calendar. Does anyone know which one? The alternative strip contained the Boss starting to ask Mark to do something, and Mark over-reacts. </dd>

<dt><span class="striptitle">Girl Guides and Terrorists</span> <span class="stripdate">1991-01-12</span> (?)</dt>
<dd>A strip that Scott Adams brings along on speaking tours that shows the dangers of mixing the wrong types of humour. This one deals with children and terrorism, a bad mix. A girl guide tries to sell Dogbert cookies and he asks if the money will be used to support terrorism. She replies that only money from their bake sale is used that way. More details are in this <a href="/2013/11/30/unpublished-dilbert-girl-guide-cookies.html">post</a>. (The date is fuzzy. <span class="stripdate">1991-01-12</span> is my best guess)</dd>

<dt><span class="striptitle">The Dawn of Dilbert</span> <span class="stripdate">1988</span></dt>
<dd>The original 50 strips that Scott put together to sell to a syndicate. Most of the ideas in these have been re-used in newspaper strips. They're in <span class="booktitle">Dilbert 2.0</span>.</dd>

<dt><span class="striptitle">Early Sketches</span> <span class="stripdate">pre-1988</span></dt>
<dd>A selection of Scott's early drawings and jokes from before the submission package. They're reprinted in <span class="booktitle">Dilbert 2.0</span>.</dd>

<dt><span class="striptitle">Dogbert Origin Strips</span> <span class="stripdate">1997</span></dt>
<dd>The Dogbert origin strips are at These nine previously-unpublished strips show how Dogbert and Dilbert met and take the characters in another direction. Not published anywhere.</dd>

<dd>Scott wrote an <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704025304575285000265955016.html">article</a> for the WSJ about wanting to invest in BP because of the oil spill ("Betting on the Bad Guys"). The article was accompanied by a single panel comic. The panel showed a man reading an article on his computer explaining that BP planned to plug the oil leak with Florida. The man wondered when evil became so awesome.</dd>

<dt><span class="striptitle">Plop Spinoff</span> <span class="stripdate">2001</span></dt>
<dd>This is not Dilbert, but Scott Adams experimented with a spin-off about a hairless Elbonian called Plop. It didn't go anywhere. There were 28 strips in total, and aren't online.</dd>

<dt><span class="striptitle">Bid Delivery</span> <span class="stripdate">2003-08-19</span></dt>
<dd>Correct and "broken" versions of this strip were published that day. The Boss's line of dialogue in the first panel, missing from the broken version, is "I'll deliver it to them".</dd>

<dt><span class="striptitle">Six Week Book Gap</span> <span class="stripdate">Starting 2012-08-27</span></dt>
<dd>For the first time, there is a gap between collection books of six weeks. The book Your New Job Title is "Accomplice" ends on 2012-08-26, and the book I Sense a Coldness in Your Mentoring begins on 2012-10-08. That's a span of 6 weeks. Get them at the Dilbert site starting on <a href="http://www.dilbert.com/fast/2012-08-27/">2012-08-27</a>. Are they published elsewhere? I haven't seen where.</dd>

<dt><span class="striptitle">April Fools</span> <span class="stripdate">1997-04-01</span></dt>
<dd>This April Fools day strip was drawn by Bil Keane of <span class="comictitle">The Family Circus</span> fame and appears in <span class="booktitle">Journey to Cubeville</span>. Scott Adams drew the April Fools panel for <span class="comictitle">The Family Circus</span> that day and presumably appears in some <span class="booktitle">The Family Circus</span> collection. Does anyone know which one? For the completist, there's also a Bil Keane <span class="stripdate">1997-04-02</span> follow-up to the Scott Adams' <span class="comictitle">The Family Circus</span> April Fools panel.</dd>

<dt><span class="striptitle">Office Party</span> <span class="stripdate">1991-03-31</span></dt>
<dd>If you look in the book <span class="bookname">Bring Me the Head of Willy the Mailboy</span>, notice that a Sunday strip should appear between pages 108 and 109. They missed <a href="http://www.dilbert.com/fast/1991-03-31/">this strip</a>, for whatever reason.</dd>
