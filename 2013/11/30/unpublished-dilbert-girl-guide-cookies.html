<p>Here&#8217;s a strip that has never been published in the newspapers. The content is a little too risky for newspapers, so it never got published. Scott Adams said his editor turned it down.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s how I got it. Back in 1992, Scott Adams came to my city on a speaking tour. I did not attend, however, the next day a picture of Scott and this strip appeared in the business section of a local newspaper.</p>

<p><a href="/images/dt-girl-guide-presentation.png"><img src="/images/dt-girl-guide-lq.png" alt="Dilbert strip with a Girl Guide" title="" /></a></p>

<p>The following is an excerpt from an article that appeared with the photo in the Calgary Herald on 1992-12-11:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Scott Adams, creator of the comic strip Dilbert, displays one of his favorite strips, a joke that never made it to publication.</p>

<p>The segment shows a girl guide selling wafers.</p>

<p>&#8220;How can I be sure my money won&#8217;t go to support terrorist organizations in other countries?&#8221; asks Dogbert, the star of the strip.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re confusing this with our bake sale,&#8221; responds the girl.</p>

<p>The audience laughs, but Adams makes his point: avoid opposing ideas in the same joke, such as violence and children or sex and Christmas.</p>

<p>&#8220;They can cause offence by association,&#8221; he said.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Unfortunately, the picture was not that great and the strip is a bit fuzzy and the lighting is uneven.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve done minimal cleanup on the above image and it still looks bad.  If someone with better &#8216;shop skills than me wants to try to clean it up to make it looks like a regular strip, please be my guest. I will post the results on this site. Here&#8217;s my <a href="/images/dt-girl-guide-scan.tiff">original scan</a>.</p>

<p>In my humble opinion, I think this is a great strip and more people should see it. I should not have sat on this for so long.</p>

<p>You can also see this strip in this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKRAy4Rr_SE">video</a> of Scott Adams&#8217; stage presentation.</p>
